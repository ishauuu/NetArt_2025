    <p><h1>Ode to Daniel Caesar</h1>
        <h2><em>Get You</em></h2></p>
  <p>Through drought and famine, natural disasters
    My baby has been around for me
    Kingdoms have fallen, angels be calling
    None of that could ever make me leave
    Every time I look into your eyes I see it
    You're all I need
    Every time I get a bit inside I feel it

    Ooh, who would've thought I'd get you?
    <br>
    Ooh, who would've thought I'd get you? 
    
    And when we're making love
    Your cries they can be heard from far and wide
    It's only the two of us
    Everything I need's between those thighs
    Every time I look into your eyes I see it
    You're all I need
    Every time I get a bit inside I feel it
    </p>
